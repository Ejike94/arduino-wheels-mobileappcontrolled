# arduino-wheels-mobileappcontrolled
Arduino wheels robot programmed in C directionable controlled by a Mobile App programmed in Android

Two folders are found, one is the Android/Java code, for the Mobile App and the other is the C Code for the Arduino Robot Wheels.

The connection between the two devices is made thorugh Bluetooth.

The mobile App has been build with arrows that when pressed they send a message to the serial of the arduino, the arduino recieves the message translate it in a signal which will move the wheels.


NOTE:

The arrows when pressed changes colour following the tap event in order to give the feeling that the arrow is being pressed.

I hope this code will serve you well :)
